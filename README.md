# Composing pictures

The program is free-to-use for all kinds of developers.


### What does the project do
***
The program does alpha compositing of two or more pictures.


### Why is the project useful
***
Alpha compositing is a task of a frequent occurence, therefore it makes sense to try to speed it up
using different approaches.


### Functionality
***
Define directive at the beginning of main.cpp switches modes of the program:
    - showing picture which is a result of alpha compositing of pictures that were given via SFML library
    - just doing calculations connected with alpha compositing, in this case FPS counter is being shown at the top left corner
    - if both defines are defined, picture is being shown with the FPS counter.
 
Showing the result in a window is implemented via [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
